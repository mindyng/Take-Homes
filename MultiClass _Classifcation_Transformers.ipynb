This process can be modified for individual use cases. The sections are:\n\n1. [Importing Python Libraries and preparing the environment](#section01)\n2. [Importing and Pre-Processing the domain data](#section02)\n3. [Preparing the Dataset and Dataloader](#section03)\n4. [Creating the Neural Network for Fine Tuning](#section04)\n5. [Fine Tuning the Model](#section05)\n6. [Validating the Model Performance](#section06)\n7. [Saving the model and artifacts for Inference in Future](#section07)\n\n#### Technical Details\n\nThis script leverages on multiple tools designed by other teams. Details of the tools used below. Please ensure that these elements are present in your setup to successfully implement this script.\n\n - Data: \n\t - We are using the News aggregator dataset available at by [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/News+Aggregator)\n\t - We are referring only to the first csv file from the data dump: `newsCorpora.csv`\n\t - There are `422937` rows of data.  Where each row has the following data-point: \n\t\t - ID Numeric ID  \n\t\t - TITLE News title  \n\t\t - URL Url  \n\t\t - PUBLISHER Publisher name  \n\t\t - CATEGORY News category (b = business, t = science and technology, e = entertainment, m = health)  \n\t\t - STORY Alphanumeric ID of the cluster that includes news about the same story  \n\t\t - HOSTNAME Url hostname  \n\t\t - TIMESTAMP Approximate time the news was published, as the number of milliseconds since the epoch 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970\n\n\n - Language Model Used:\n\t - DistilBERT this is a smaller transformer model as compared to BERT or Roberta. It is created by process of distillation applied to Bert. \n\t - [Blog-Post](https://medium.com/huggingface/distilbert-8cf3380435b5)\n\t - [Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108)\n     - [Documentation for python](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html)\n\n\n - Hardware Requirements:\n\t - Python 3.6 and above\n\t - Pytorch, Transformers and All the stock Python ML Libraries\n\t - GPU enabled setup \n\n\n - Script Objective:\n\t - The objective of this script is to fine tune DistilBERT to be able to classify a news headline into the following categories:\n\t\t - Business\n\t\t - Technology\n\t\t - Health\n\t\t - Entertainment \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='section01'></a>\n### Importing Python Libraries and preparing the environment\n\nAt this step we will be importing the libraries and modules needed to run our script. Libraries are:\n* Pandas\n* Pytorch\n* Pytorch Utils for Dataset and Dataloader\n* Transformers\n* DistilBERT Model and Tokenizer\n\nFollowed by that we will preapre the device for CUDA execeution. This configuration is needed if you want to leverage on onboard GPU.

We will also define the Dataloader that will feed  the data in batches to the neural network for suitable training and processing. \nDataset and Dataloader are constructs of the PyTorch library for defining and controlling the data pre-processing and its passage to neural network. For further reading into Dataset and Dataloader read the [docs at PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html)\n\n#### *Triage* Dataset Class\n- This class is defined to accept the Dataframe as input and generate tokenized output that is used by the DistilBERT model for training. \n- We are using the DistilBERT tokenizer to tokenize the data in the `TITLE` column of the dataframe. \n- The tokenizer uses the `encode_plus` method to perform tokenization and generate the necessary outputs, namely: `ids`, `attention_mask`\n- To read further into the tokenizer, [refer to this document](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html#distilberttokenizer)\n- `target` is the encoded category on the news headline. \n- The *Triage* class is used to create 2 datasets, for training and for validation.\n- *Training Dataset* is used to fine tune the model: **80% of the original data**\n- *Validation Dataset* is used to evaluate the performance of the model. The model has not seen this data during training. \n\n#### Dataloader\n- Dataloader is used to for creating training and validation dataloader that load data to the neural network in a defined manner. This is needed because all the data from the dataset cannot be loaded to the memory at once, hence the amount of dataloaded to the memory and then passed to the neural network needs to be controlled.\n- This control is achieved using the parameters such as `batch_size` and `max_len`.\n- Training and Validation dataloaders are used in the training and validation part of the flow respectively"},{"metadata":{"id":"JrBr2YesGdO_","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Defining some key variables that will be used later on in the training\nMAX_LEN = 512\nTRAIN_BATCH_SIZE = 4\nVALID_BATCH_SIZE = 2\nEPOCHS = 1\nLEARNING_RATE = 1e-05\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-cased')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"2vX7kzaAHu39","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"class Triage(Dataset):\n    def __init__(self, dataframe, tokenizer, max_len):\n        self.len = len(dataframe)\n        self.data = dataframe\n        self.tokenizer = tokenizer\n        self.max_len = max_len\n        \n    def __getitem__(self, index):\n        title = str(self.data.TITLE[index])\n        title = \" \".join(title.split())\n        inputs = self.tokenizer.encode_plus(\n            title,\n            None,\n            add_special_tokens=True,\n            max_length=self.max_len,\n            pad_to_max_length=True,\n            return_token_type_ids=True\n        )\n        ids = inputs['input_ids']\n        mask = inputs['attention_mask']\n\n        return {\n            'ids': torch.tensor(ids, dtype=torch.long),\n            'mask': torch.tensor(mask, dtype=torch.long),\n            'targets': torch.tensor(self.data.ENCODE_CAT[index], dtype=torch.long)\n        } \n    \n    def __len__(self):\n        return self.len","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"Zcwq13c0NE9c","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Creating the dataset and dataloader for the neural network\n\ntrain_size = 0.8\ntrain_dataset=df.sample(frac=train_size,random_state=200).reset_index(drop=True)\ntest_dataset=df.drop(train_dataset.index).reset_index(drop=True)\n\n\nprint(\"FULL Dataset: {}\".format(df.shape))\nprint(\"TRAIN Dataset: {}\".format(train_dataset.shape))\nprint(\"TEST Dataset: {}\".format(test_dataset.shape))\n\ntraining_set = Triage(train_dataset, tokenizer, MAX_LEN)\ntesting_set = Triage(test_dataset, tokenizer, MAX_LEN)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"l1BgA1CkQSYa","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_params = {'batch_size': TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE,\n                'shuffle': True,\n                'num_workers': 0\n                }\n\ntest_params = {'batch_size': VALID_BATCH_SIZE,\n                'shuffle': True,\n                'num_workers': 0\n                }\n\ntraining_loader = DataLoader(training_set, **train_params)\ntesting_loader = DataLoader(testing_set, **test_params)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='section04'></a>\n### Creating the Neural Network for Fine Tuning\n\n#### Neural Network\n - We will be creating a neural network with the `DistillBERTClass`. \n - This network will have the DistilBERT Language model followed by a `dropout` and finally a `Linear` layer to obtain the final outputs. \n - The data will be fed to the DistilBERT Language model as defined in the dataset. \n - Final layer outputs is what will be compared to the `encoded category` to determine the accuracy of models prediction. \n - We will initiate an instance of the network called `model`.
