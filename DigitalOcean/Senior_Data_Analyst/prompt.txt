This assessment is meant to give you an example of the types of problems you’d be likely to encounter as a Data Analyst at DigitalOcean, and to give us a sense of how you would approach solving such a problem. 
For the ‘Free Response’ section, given that you do not have access to internal Digital Ocean data which would be required for a holistic analysis, we do not expect a comprehensive and overly detailed recommendation, but rather we’re more interested in clarity, simplicity, and not taking up too much of your free time.
If you find yourself spending longer than about two hours on this, please feel free to stop, write a short summary of how you would plan on finishing, and submit that along with what you have written so far. An incomplete assignment will not be considered inferior to a complete one just because it is incomplete. We just want to see a sample of what you do given a realistic problem scenario.
SQL -- Use any flavor, assume postgresql functionality is possible (e.g. window functions).  Where assumptions need to be made, please note them.

	• Given the two tables below, construct a SQL query that would return:
		1. Monthly spend totals by user’s most recent email
		2. A field showing their count of droplets used that month
		3. A field that gives a value of “Low Value” if the customer spent <$500 and “High Value” if the customer spent >=$500 in a given month.
